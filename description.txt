Better Mod List aims to slightly overhaul and generally improve the tModLoader mod list. Adding more utilities, information, and QoL features.

I have a lot more planned, so stay tuned!

v0.1.1
* Mod List icons will be resized to fit like on the Workshop menu. This means mods with improper icon sizes will still display.
* Fixed an issue with icon offsets not being applied when there was no icon, now all mods without icons will receive a filler icon.

v0.1.0
* Fixed a long-standing tModLoader bug that caused localzation to not be updated in tML's UIs when changing languages.
* Added a toggle for chat tags in the Mods menu.
* Homepage links can now be seen on the Mods menu.
* More comprehensive mod browser key icon.
* Easy-to-see author and version information.
